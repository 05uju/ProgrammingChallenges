# PMG Programming Challenges

A few small programming challenges that let us see how job candidates work.

## What Languages Can I Use?

Just about anything you like, but we work mostly with...

- PHP
- JavaScript (node & in browser)
- Python
- Go

## How do I ask questions?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/AgencyPMG/ProgrammingChallenges/issues).

## How long should I spend on this?

Hopefully less than about an hour. If you find a problem is taking a long time,
let us know! Chances are it's probably too big for this set of challenges.

## How do I submit my answer?

Send an email to tech@pmg.com or reach out to the person who gave you the
challenge.
